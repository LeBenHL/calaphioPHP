This will be my 7th and final semester with APO.  In my time here, I've learned much about value of the pledge system, its strengths, and its weaknesses.  The pledge program is an integral part of the entire fraternity, which makes it of paramount importance to train top-notch actives.  To refrain from boring you guys too much w/ a long and drawn out platform, I will summarize some key proposals, through which I plan to improve the pledging semester:
</p>
1.)	Introduce some inter-committee service projects/fellowships (ie. Committee Olympics).<br />
2.)	Assign alumni contacts for professional/career advice<br />
3.)	Restructuring PR agenda's to be less lecture based and more interactive<br />
4.)	Conduct one or two PR's outside of classrooms<br />
5.)	Install a point system of recognition for deserving pledges<br />

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
My goal is the train pledges who are responsible, committed, and enthusiastic, and I plan to lead by example.  The principles of LFS are thrown around too lightly, and I will make it an endeavor to instill a stronger sense of our core principles into the chapter through the new pledges and P-Comm.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I would like to keep the rest of the pledging process otherwise in tact, as I have tremendous faith in the effectiveness of many of the requirements to foster good actives.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Please feel free to ask me any questions and for clarifications on any of the above, or for anything else.

What is she standing on? Read on here!
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Leadership, Friendship, &amp; Service. The way I see it, you cannot have one without the others. As pledgemaster, I recognize the importance of being able to unite these 3 core principles and guide the pledge class on a journey to make these 3 principles their own, to be able to embody and personify Alpha Phi Omega's core values in their everyday lives to make themselves and the world around them a better place.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
The current pledge program is a fine program to keep. It showcases the committed pledges and the pledges that are in danger of not crossing. The program is rigorous, but it still has flexibility built in, too. I have no intentions of changing the requirements of the pledge program, unless the chapter or the pledge committee calls for it. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I would like to put a stronger focus on the traditions and history of Alpha Phi Omega, along with the respect that must be paid to each. With the strong knowledge &amp; respect of both, the chapter will be upheld for future semesters in capable hands. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;"><i>
The most important aspect of pledging that I want to emphasize is unity: unity among the pledge committee, &amp; unity among the pledge class.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Bringing the pledge committee together as a tight knit group of leaders &amp; friends to guide the pledge class into becoming actives will be a challenge, as selected trainers will be from different pledge classes, &amp; families, or they simply might not know another on a more than acquaintance basis. This is a challenge I am prepared for, as this will only enhance the guidance of the pledge class. The importance and criticalness of a pledge committee that is willing to dedicate their time to pledges and to each other on pledge committee itself is something I will constantly look after, since this has a great impact on the pledge program and how the program is executed as a whole.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Bringing the entire pledge class as a solid unit of one is another tremendous focus of mine. This is a huge undertaking, as the pledge classes are getting bigger as shown by past semesters, but with dedication &amp; love this can be achieved. A united pledge class will produce strong pledges that will support each other during their journey of finding what LFS means for them individually. This will in turn produce strong actives that will carry the chapter and its traditions in the years further along down the road.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
With these two united fronts, along with what I mentioned earlier, I believe I can perform an outstanding job as pledgemaster. I will bring both groups together to carry out the pledge program with an unbreakable dedication to ensure a great group of potential actives.

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
One year, two semesters, the time of my life â€“ however you'd like to refer to it, my experience with Alpha Phi Omega has heightened my college experience to a level that was once unimaginable to me. To be quite honest, I used to believe that after pledging semester, all semesters that followed would not be able to live up to what I had experienced JCJ semester. However, active life has proved me wrong. Having bigged, chaired many events, and been on PComm, I've come to the realization that as an active, I too, can make change in the chapter. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
JCJ semester was but a steppingstone.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
There are 3 components to my vision for MVP: the promotion of <b>R</b>ush, <b>R</b>etention, &amp; <b>F</b>amily
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
<b>Rush</b><br />
Fast forward one semester. CC Rush. It was probably the most hectic time for a chapter transitioning to double in size. Move on to WK Rush, and add an additional 52 pledges. Rush is notably one of the most important components of the Alpha Phi Omega experience. However, I believe that we must now slow it down and concentrate on rejuvenating our active body in the chapter. If elected MVP, I'd like to tone it down a bit and return to a system of the traditional 3-week Rush program. This would allow for our chapter to build up even stronger active membership so that we can adjust for even larger pledge classes in the future. However, Rush would still run as usual, with flyering, tabling, and the traditional line of events.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
<b>Retention</b><br />
Here, I inquire about the current status of our chapter. Two semesters ago, the population of our chapter was a mere fraction of what we are today. Having grown so quickly, we have yet to have had a chance to stop and breathe. Well, I believe THIS is our time to breathe.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Now more than ever, with a chapter larger than ever before, I feel that the Membership VP must lead our chapter into a state of higher retention and greater active membership. Since our chapter has grown, there has also been a significant growth in the number of depleges and bad-standing actives. One major question on my mind at the beginning of last semester was: "Where did all the MLN's go?" With the recent surge in the number of actives in the chapter, many once extremely dedicated members have found it difficult to integrate themselves back into what is almost an entirely new chapter. Well, I'd like to eliminate this notion of awkwardness. If elected MVP, I'd like to work to better communication with all actives, good and bad-standing, in order to attempt to motivate them to take more of a role in our chapter. I propose that the first step in initiating this is by first opening all lines of communication with actives and encouraging them to participate in active events, fellowships, and the ongoing list of service projects.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
<b>Family System</b><br />
Appropriately deemed one of the most important aspects of our chapter is our distinct family system. As Membership VP, I would work to help the bigs become better bigs, for the betterment of our chapter as a whole. I recall my first time bigging, and how I found it particularly awkward and difficult to approach my littles the first week. I grew to love them as if they were my own siblings, but I always think: What if I had had that extra week? Would our semester have run even more smoothly? As Membership Vice President, I'd like to maximize communication with all the bigs. The way I see it, the MVP is the big of the bigs. Having bigged twice, I'd feel completely comfortable welcoming any first time bigs who need advice to come talk with me. I am confident that had I had this resource available when I first bigged, the semester would have gone even better than it resulted (which was still awesome!). Thus, if given the opportunity, I would have informal checkups with each small family, bigs and littles, throughout the semester, just to make sure that all is running smoothly.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Having pledged almost one year ago, I have gained an insight into what being a member of Alpha Phi Omega â€“ Gamma Gamma really means. The work, and the fun, definitely does not end after pledging semester. We must get this message across to all the new actives and pledges, as they are the future of our chapter.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
All said, I hope that I will be given the opportunity to contribute and initiate my plans for the rejuvenation of this chapter. I know it may seem an overload of ambitious ideas to intake, but I hope that from this you have gained trust in my ability and potential in my bid for Membership Vice President.

</div>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
It may come as a surprise to many that I am running for Fellowship Vice President.
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I've spent a great amount of time with the Administrative counterpart of Alpha Phi Omega, having been in Admin-Comm as a pledge, co-chairing The Stylus, and even an Administrative Committee trainer for the WK Pledge Class.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
My Aphio experience so far has been "specific", and I now want to expand my leadership and contributions to other areas of Alpha Phi Omega, and more particularly, fellowship.  Fellowship is what sets Alpha Phi Omega apart from many other community service organizations, and is definitely one of the components that drew me into pledging a year ago.  I want to continue pushing and improving the Fellowship program that keeps our chapter together.  With this, I plan to preserve traditional events that take place in the spring, such as Talent Show, IC Poker, IC Luau, and of course, Banquet.  In addition, I plan to continue IC Basketball, as it was a huge success!  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
There are a couple things I would like to workout and introduce to the chapter:<br />
â€¢	Starting up Intramural Sports teams at the RSF in different sports: Volleyball, Soccer, Ultimate Frisbee, Dodgeball, Softball, Basketball and many more!<br />
â€¢	A Gamma Gamma "Open Mic Night" for poetry reading and story telling!<br /><br />
Most importantly, I plan on working openly with the brothers in the chapter to ensure that the Fellowship program best benefits them, and to uphold the fellowship tradition that has "glued" our chapter together.
