<h2><a name="intro">Our History: Chapter History</a></h2><br/>
<p>The seventy-fifth chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, dubbed Gamma Gamma, was founded in 1939 at the University of California at Berkeley, in a small ceremony with National President Dr. H. Roe. Bartle in attendance. During the first few turbulent years, many of the chapter records were lost. The advent of World World II also disrupted operations at the chapter and national level. Most pre-WWII records of Gamma Gamma are unavailable. The following is a partial history of Gamma Gamma after WWII. Because of WWII, many chapters of Alpha Phi Omega became inactive, including Gamma Gamma. However, after the war, many members worked tirelessly to re-chapter lost chapters and continued to serve the community. In 1947, members of the dissolved Gamma Gamma chapter convened to discuss plans to continue their dedication to serving their community and country. The first meeting was held on Tuesday, April 15, 1947, at seven o'clock in the evening at the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity House. All former members and Scouts were invited to become active members of Alpha Phi Omega, Gamma Gamma chapter. Acting chairman, Frank Brown, opened the meeting and temporary officers were elected. They were as follows: <br/>  <b>President:</b> Frank Brown <br/> <b>Vice-President:</b> Ken Caldwell <br/> <b>Secretary:</b> Charles Hargreaves <br/> <b>Treasurer:</b> Warren Kitchen <br/> On that Tuesday night, the men of Alpha Phi Omega, Gamma Gamma, decided to meet every other Tuesday night at seven in the evening. This tradition is preserved and continues to be observed. At the fourth general meeting, the official executive committee was elected: <br/> <b>President:</b> Bill McCullough <br/> <b>Vice-President:</b> Bob Miller <br/> <b>Secretary:</b> Don Atwater <br/> <b>Treasurer:</b> Jack Evert <br/> <b>Historian:</b> Phil Ham <br/> <b>Alumni Secretary:</b> Louis Ravn-Linde <br/> At that meeting, chapter dues were established to be two dollars per semester, and national dues were ten dollars for each member. The initiation banquet was held on May 9, 1947. Brothers from Gamma Beta, San Jose State, were present to provide witness to the occasion. The Gamma Gamma chapter faded in 1971. After five years, in the spring of 1976, the first project of Gamma Gamma was held but failed miserably. On January 8, 1976, the recharted members filed an application with the University of California, Berkeley, to be recognized as an "official" student organization. On March 4, 1977, the formal rechartering was held and the elected officers consisted of: <br/> <b>President:</b> G. J. Ma <br/> <b>Vice-President:</b> R. B. Fong <br/> <b>Secretary:</b> K. S. Tsuji <br/> <b>Treasurer:</b> L. J. Pang <br/> <b>Pledgemaster:</b> M. S. Davis <br/> Other rechartering members included: S. Bernal, J. Chen, H. D. Feit, J. B. Han III, M. Kan, N. Nickerson Jr, C. Wagner, D. Young, and J. A. Merslich Jr. The rechartering initiation was held April 2, 1977, with Iota Phi from the University of California at Davis acting as the host chapter. <br/></p>
