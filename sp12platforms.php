<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Hi Gamma Gamma!<br><br>
A semester ago I came into Alpha Phi Omega with the intention of doing service. That sentiment has stayed and grown within me as one of the main reasons why I have stayed with APO. During my time as a pledge and an active I have come to find again and again that giving back to others is one of my greatest joys in life. At the same time I have noticed some actives beginning to lose the drive to serve that they once had. While I do not wish to force my own ideals onto others, as SVP, I hope to be able to instill the value of service within new pledges and to rekindle a passion for serving that some of our active members may have lost. My primary method of doing so will be to increase the availability and freedom of service opportunities.
<br><br>
<b>Expansion and Maintenance of Service</b><br>
Like my two predecessors before me, I firmly believe in the continuing expansion of our service. The availability of new high quality service projects from which to choose will provide our brothers with a chance to experience service out of the ordinary. Sometimes all that is needed is a change of pace. Furthermore, I want to find additional long term/regular service projects (the Habitat for Humanity build days being an existing example of this) with which the efforts of our brothers can be seen over time. In doing so, I hope that a rapport of sorts can be created between the volunteer and the project, resulting in a self-desire to continue attending the project to see it through. Outreach to other service organizations like Circle K, Rotaract, and the Cal Corps Public Service Center might also provide unique service opportunities as well.
<br><br>
At the same time I also plan to continue maintaining the existing relationships we have with various service projects (Project Open Hand, SF Food Bank, and Dorothy Day House to name a few) in order to keep these opportunities available.
<br><br>
<b>Freedom of Service</b><br>
A concern that I have heard regarding participating in service is that the requirements imposed upon actives, in particular the 4 C&#39;s, are difficult to complete and can seem restrictive. My opinion is that service should come out of one&#39;s desire rather than an obligation to do so. However, I also agree with the reasoning of our current SVP that the 4 C&#39;s promote diversity of service within the chapter. As a compromise, I propose that rather than completing all of the 4 C&#39;s that only 3 of the 4 be required. This ensures diversity of service while allowing actives more freedom to choose which service projects they want to go to.
<br><br>
<b>Evaluations/Feedback</b><br>
I intend to take evaluations and feedback regarding service events very seriously. Negatively reviewed events will be taken down to make way for new, better ones. I will do my best to find service projects that fulfill individual requests. I want to make sure that the service that Gamma Gamma does is not only productive and useful but also rewarding to the actives themselves.
<br><br>
Through these methods I believe that every brother will eventually find at least a few service events that will pique and hold his/her interest. Thank you all for your consideration and I hope to serve you all as your next Service Vice President!
<br><br>

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dear Gamma Gamma,<br><br>
A year and a half ago, I pledged Alpha Phi Omega to continue doing service in college after high
school and to meet new people. Immediately, I fell in love with the pledging process, the friends
I have made, and the greater opportunities the chapter has to offer. If given the opportunity,
I would pledge again (if I could somehow deactivate and self-induce amnesia) and develop
the same sentiments as I have now. During my pledging semester, I wrote ambitiously in my
reflections that I would continue staying active in the chapter if I crossed by bigging, chairing
for committees, doing PComm, and doing Pledgemaster. After crossing, I tried to maintain
visibility in the chapter and took advantage of service and fellowship events to get to know other
actives and pledges. So far, I have done three out of the four, and this upcoming semester, I
plan to fulfill the final quarter of my goals. Anyone who has done PComm has said that it is like
pledging all over again. As I head into my fifth semester in Alpha Phi Omega, I am prepared to
pledge again, for the third time.<br><br>
<b>Pledge Class Limit</b><br>
As Pledgemaster, I aim for a higher limit on the pledge class, for example, fifty or sixty pledges.
With a larger pledge class, there are more niches for the pledges to find a place to belong.
Of course having a united pledge class would be ideal but when pledges feel that they are
comfortable with each other, they would be more willing to come out and participate, which
would create a stronger and more involved pledge class. Pledges have the option to go through
self-selection when they feel they do not see themselves in APhiO, which would naturally
reduce the pledge class size. I would not want to defer anyone from pledging at the immediate
beginning.<br><br>
<b>Pledge-Active Relationship</b><br>
Like JS semester, I would like to increase interaction between actives and pledges by
maintaining the signature page for actives and face-to-face, written interviews. That way, the
pledges are exposed to more actives and learn about the different roles that they can take in the
future in the chapter. With better relationships with actives, pledges also have the chance to find
a place with actives and thus, remain active in the future.<br><br>
<b>Pledge Committee</b><br>
In terms of PComm, I would want a PComm similar to that of the one that I was on, CPZ (Fall
2011). That semester, we took on a friendly approach to the relationship with the pledges. We
maintained respect for each other and professionalism but still retained a sense of closeness
through camaraderie. What worked during CPZ semester to help pledges get to know PComm
were the multiple-on-ones (in which I like to call fun-on-ones, because they are fun). In a smaller
setting, the pledges feel more comfortable talking to PComm and get to know them more on a
closer level.<br><br>
<b>Signature Requirements</b><br>
With more fun-on-ones set up, that would reduce the need for emphasized signature
requirements. I would have PComm have one mandatory signature requirement which is get
to know PComm. This way, there is more flexibility and freedom to create a fun-on-one with
PComm. Any other signature requirement would be non-materlistic and reflect on more of L, F,
and S.<br><br>
<b>Visibility</b><br>
I would like to be transparent between PComm, the pledge class, and actives. I would have
PComm set up a spreadsheet and requirement checklist and have them update it so that the
bigs/parents would know how their littles are doing along the way and can stop any potential
problems before it escalates. Also, I would have PComm send out multiple reports to summarize
the data they have compiled on their trainees. I would have PComm sign up for events
throughout the semester in order to be more visible to pledges, so they can get to know PComm.<br><br>
With these ideas in mind, I hope to serve as your Fall 2012 Pledgemaster. I hope to make a good
pledge class and coach them to be good actives in the future.<br><br>
In Leadership, Friendship, and Service,<br><br>

	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dear Gamma Gamma,<br><br>
My name is Celina Zeng and I am running for the pledgemaster position of Fall 2012.  I pledged Geoffrey Lee semester my second semester in college so I'm pretty old APO-wise!  Since I'm so old, I've learned a lot of things-things that need change, things that need fixing and things that should stay the way they are!  As pledgemaster, I hope to make some of these changes happen, maybe not overnight, but starting with the pledges, Pcomm and I will be working closely to ensure an amazing active turnout!  I believe that the pledging process is one of the most influential factors in determining the active status of the pledge after they cross, from probationary semester and thereafter.  I want to be immersed in the pledging process, where I can perhaps help develop the quality of service that is performed by the pledges by holding Pcomm and myself as examples for leadership, friendship, and service.    
	<br><br>When I first joined APO, I didn't know what I was looking for or honestly, what my goals and values were.  But being in APO, having the chance to grow and mature and really develop my stronger characteristics is one the best gifts college and APO could have given me.  I want to be able to help pledges grow and create a better active turnout and retention rate.  My goals are to create a cohesive and close pledge class, that value the service they can do, the friends they make, and the leaders they'll become.   
<br><br><b>Limiting the pledge size</b><br>
	 In all honesty, I cannot give a specific number or size at this moment; it all depends on future factors.  I am most likely going to keep the pledge class around CPZ size or smaller, but I want to take into account the number of bigs/aunts/uncles, to keep a one-to-one ratio between pledges and family members.     
<br><br><b>Pledge committee</b><br>
	Of course, where would one be without a strong pledge committee?  For Pcomm, I would choose characteristics that I deem most important in a strong leader.  Reliability, approachability, and visibility are my top choices because it means that Pcomm will always be out there and ready to help pledges.  It means that the pledges won't be afraid to attend office hours for fear of being overshadowed by other pledges, because Pcomm will give equal opportunity and chance to meet during service projects or outside of APO.  To make sure that they maintain professionalism and visibility, I would require a choice of going above and beyond in service hours and fellowships (JS Pcomm), or making more outside APO bonding events (CPZ Pcomm).  I make this at the discretion of Pcomm, because I know that they have to concentrate on academics as well and I wouldn't want them to burnout towards the end of pledging.  Also, I realize the importance of keeping the pledge class de-stressed as well, and being out there and available as Pcomm will hopefully keep signature panic to a minimum.  
<br><br><b>Transparency</b><br>
	I plan on requiring complete transparency between trainer(s) and trainee meaning an open Google doc of each pledge with their office hours and pledge and committee requirements available for them to see.  This way there aren't any miscommunication issues towards the end of pledging and pledges can balance their own schedules.  This Google doc will be available to bigs as well, because sometimes family is a more encouraging motivator and are closer than a committee can be.  
<br><br><b>Time commitment</b><br>
	This semester I will be taking between 13-15 units, depending on the whims of Telebears!  Although I will most likely continue working at my job, it will mostly be working at home.  
<br><br><b>Big changes:</b><br>
	Addressing the issue of academics, I really liked Armand's idea of a study hour.  However, I want to amend his idea into a 2-3 hour bi-weekly study time that is non-mandatory but highly recommended.  This way, if pledges actually want to come and study they can join a big group of people who can go out to eat later, and get work done as well!
	I want to focus on turning out great actives, but in order for them to sign up for chairing positions after pledging, they have to know what it entails and if it interests them!  So, in addition to the five interviews they will do, I would also require a brief, summary/interview of a chairing position of their choice, hopefully one that is interesting to them and will later inspire them to apply!
	Negative office hours for those who skip class.

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dear Gamma Gamma,<br><br>
My name is Benjamin Le and I pledged KS semester. Pledging for Alpha Phi Omega has been one of the best experiences so far in my college career. Initially, I pledged Alpha Phi Omega because I loved service back in high school and wanted to continue that tradition. Never did I imagine that I would meet so many wonderful new people in this chapter. Alpha Phi Omega has given me so much already that I want to know give back to the chapter by running for an executive position. Given my experience and abilities, I can make the most impact on this chapter by becoming Admin VP.
<br><br>
In short, the three main jobs that Admin VP is responsible for is to (1)Manage the Chapter Stylus, (2) maintain and improve the website, and (3) reserve rooms for chapter events.
<br><br>
One of the features I liked in this semester&#39;s stylus is the use columns in the newsletter. I particularly enjoyed readings the advice column this year and would like to expand on the idea by adding for featured columnists to the Stylus. These people would be given a column in the Stylus and choose whatever subject mosts interests them (sports, tech, politics) and be given the chance to write about it every other week.
<br><br>
The biggest responsibility that I believe I can make the biggest impact in is in the Chapter Website. Although the website is definitely usable in serves most of our needs in registering and evaluating events, I believe there are a couple things we could do to improve on the website. As you may already know, navigating the site through the use of a mobile browser on a iPhone or Android is not the most satisfying experience in the world. This is because the website was not built for a mobile interface and as a result, many of the buttons are too small to press. There is a lot of features of the website that most mobile users will not use as well. Thus, I wish to create a dedicated mobile web page for the site. This would make it easier for mobile users to use and navigation will be streamlined so that it is easy to access information mobile users want to see. Another feature I could add is a way to make it easier to text people the day before an event. Right now, one must add in numbers one at a time manually and send a group message which is very tedious. One way to remedy this problem is to give the website the feature to send text messages directly from the website to all the attendees analogous to the &quot;Email Attendees&quot; link. These messages could be automated as well if the chapter chooses to. One more feature I wish to add is integrate Pcomm&#39;s progress reports to the website. Right now, Pcomm would often create Google doc&#39;s and share them with the bigs to allow them to keep track of their little. However, these links often get forgotten or lost in the pile of emails. Thus, I propose to create a special &quot;Admin&quot; power for bigs such that they are able to see how far their littles are in their requirements. Another feature that could be useful is to allow people to sign up for committees much like they do for service and fellowship. Currently, one must jump through the hoops and respond to emails to chairs before they can be accepted onto a committee. By adding this feature, it makes it easier for actives to join committees and Ex-comm will always be able to know who is in what committee at all times.
<br><br>
As for reserving rooms, that&#39;s a job that cannot be substantially improved upon. However, I will do to the best of my abilities reserve the best rooms for us that are closer the South side of campus.

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Hello Gamma Gamma!<br><br>
My name is Robert Yu and I want to be your next Fellowship Vice President. In my opinion, the best aspect of APO is fellowships. Many brothers say they joined APO for the service, but stayed for the friends. Without fellowships, these amazing friendships would not be possible. 
<br><br>
If elected, I would make multiple improvements to the fellowship program of our chapter. One major problem I see is the fact that many brothers only know a select number of people within the chapter. In order to address this problem, I would push for an increase in the amount of fellowships required within one semester. In my opinion, five fellowships is an extremely small amount. The point of having the fellowship program is to provide the brothers of the fraternity with opportunities to interact with each other in an informal setting. If brothers only do five fellowships, there will continue to be a sense of unfamiliarity between them. Instead, I would try to make the minimum requirement eight. By having eight fellowships, brothers would go out to more events and form stronger bonds.
<br><br>
Secondly, I want to address the actual logistics of fellowships. In the past two semesters, I feel like chairs have not been doing their job of making sure everyone is well engaged in the fellowship. I want the chapter to know that chairing a fellowship is more than just making sure everyone sings toast song. The chairs should be actively engaging everyone in the fellowship and trying to make sure that the participants actually intermix with each other as opposed to staying with one group. One way I can enforce this is by &quot;dropping in&quot; on more fellowships.
<br><br>
Also, I want to continue the push of making fellowships at the beginning of the semester. I believe GG Barbeque Retreat was an excellent way of starting off the semester. It gave people a chance to reconnect with brothers and make them excited about the semester. These events are a perfect way to transition from summer break back to school and APO. 
<br><br>
Moreover, I would like to create more GG events. This semester, GG Barbeque Retreat was a great success and GG Sky High is on track to be successful as well. These events create a good way for brothers to bond with the entire chapter as opposed to staying limited to their small families. One event that I would like to bring back is GG Olympics. In the past, this event was successful and I believe that it would allow brothers to bond over friendly competition. 
<br><br>
Overall, I believe these are the main aspects that need to be addressed. If elected FVP, I would do my absolute best to act in ways that will only benefit the chapter.  Thanks!
<br><br>
