	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Hey Gamma Gamma!<br><br>

Coming into Alpha Phi Omega, the main thing on my mind was service. Although I've joined Roll Call or Funcomm, service is one of the main reasons I'm still here in APO. I feel that as college students, we are often stuck in the college bubble of getting good grades or going out to parties and we forget how lucky we are. To avoid sounding cliche, I just want to reiterate the importance of service.<br><br>

As your SVP, I want to continue our legacy as being the most active chapter in terms of service in Section 4. We've received the Golden Pan of Service the two semesters I've been part of APO and I want to continue this streak.<br><br>

<b>Expanding Service and Networking with other Service Organizations</b><br>
I want to expand our service even more into other fields and I will work hard to find service projects that maintain a high quality of service. Some ideas include the Chaparral Retirement Home, working at local animal shelters, or volunteering at blood drives here on campus. I also want to expand into education and help out K-12 schools like tours of the campus, tutoring, or even mentorship.<br><br>

However, in order to expand the variety of service projects, I want to communicate with other service organizations/Greek fraternities/sororities that do service and learn about their service projects. I think by keeping in contact with groups like Circle K, Rotaract, The Berkeley Group, etc, we can explore new service events that we may have never even heard of before.<br><br>

<b>Visibility</b><br>
I want to increase our visibility and set up some kind of service event that benefits the entire campus. This idea came from the USC Alpha Kappa chapter who hosts a yard sale for the school. I know that Michelle, our FVP, has been planning a benefit concert so if its OK with her, I'd like to collaborate with her, especially if it goes towards a philanthropic cause.<br><br>

I'd like to create a committee for having this large-scale service project. This can be similar to the pledges' PCSP except mainly for actives.<br><br>

<b>Accessibility of Service</b><br>
I'd like to find more service projects closer to Berkeley, especially within the city itself. Although its nice to go to San Francisco once in awhile, I feel there are a lot of opportunities to do service here on the East Bay, whether its Berkeley, Richmond, or Oakland.<br><br>

I would make sure to consider safety and the distance. By having closer projects, we can use AC Transit and avoid worrying about finding drivers. Furthermore, I want make sure drivers are properly compensated for driving. With rising gas prices, I want to bring up to ExComm about raising how much people pay for driver's money, especially considering paying for the bridge. Drivers are really important to the chapter and as a driver, if I am constantly hounded to drive without compensation, what's my incentive to drive? I'm racking up mileage and accumulating wear-and-tear, the least I could get is proper drivers money.<br><br>

<b>Website</b><br>
I'd like to work with the Admin VP on editing the website a bit. I think the Service tab on the website could be more elaborate and talk about the ten steps of chairing, increments for drivers money, the list of chairs for events (IE IC Service Chair, POH Liaison). That way, people always have a convenient reference for such things and chairs can run things more smoothly.<br><br>

<b>Feedback</b><br>
The most important part of this chapter is none other than the actives and I want your feedback on the types of events, how the chairs handled the event, etc. I plan to send out surveys to actives about what kind of service projects they'd like to see, which groups they'd like to work with, etc. With that, actives really have a chance to affect the chapter through their opinions and ideas.<br><br>


Thanks Gamma Gamma for taking the time to read this and together, we can continue Alpha Phi Omega's amazing dedication to service.<br><br>

	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dear Gamma Gamma,<br><br>

I can honestly say that I had never thought that I would be running for this position until quite recently. If you would have asked me about a month ago if I would run for Pledgemaster I would have probably laughed it off and said something ridiculous like, "Could you imagine what kind of Pledgemaster I would be?" I think in my subconscious though, it was something that I have wanted to do and what was really stopping me was the amount of time and energy I would have to put in if I wanted to be Pledgemaster. But I truly believe that compared to the difference that I would be able to make, it would make all the effort I plan to put in totally worth it. I decided to run because I felt that I wanted to do something really meaningful for the chapter and for me personally, I feel that I would be able to do that best by being involved with the pledge class through this position. As someone said before me, "good actives come from good pledges." If I was elected as Pledgemaster I would instill all the values of our fraternity and make great pledges who would be able to have a strong influence over the future of our chapter and continue to improve its excellence.<br><br>

When I pledged, I really had a great time and I would have to say that a big part of that had to do with my bigs, PComm, and the pledge class. I want to give the pledges that experience and so much more. I want to show them what makes our fraternity so wonderful and in a way make them kind of fall in love with everything that it stands for and the people in it so that they would care about what happens to the chapter. If I were elected Pledgemaster, I want to turnout pledges that I would be proud of and who will still be around long after I graduate. I plan to lead by example, I will show them my own passion for the chapter by attending as many service projects, fellowships, and events as possible and just showing how much I really do care. I would put together a pledge committee who has the same dedication that I have and who would strive to instill our fraternity's values to a make great group of pledges but also give the pledges a wonderful semester so that requirements are not just a checklist of things to finish because they have to but things that they would enjoy to do.<br><br>

While making my decision to run I have been struggling with imagining what kind of a Pledgemaster I would be and trying to answer that question for the last few days. I have recently come to the conclusion that I want to make the pledges feel comfortable enough to come to me with any problems they might have with pledging or just life in general. Of course I would maintain the boundary between being their Pledgemaster and their friend but I really want to be able to get to know the pledges on a deeper level rather than just on the surface. I strongly believe that by getting to know each and every one of the pledges personally, I can help them to develop their skills further into becoming better pledges and thus better members of our fraternity. I want to be a source of encouragement for them so that they would be able to reach their potentials to become better leaders, friends, and members of the community.<br><br>

Some of the things I would want to do if I was elected Pledgemaster would be to emphasize the reasons for the pledging requirements, improve the relationship between actives and pledges, and increasing the involvement of pledges after they become actives. One of the things I feel is important is explaining to pledges the reasons behind why there is a list of requirements and how those requirements are there to help them to develop into better pledges. For example pointing out the importance of attending interchapter events and how they not only improve our relationship with other chapters but how our chapter can improve based upon what we see works at other chapters. As an active I have seen how actives feel disconnected from pledges outside of their small family and I want to create opportunities to improve the relationship between the two groups because I feel that this would help unify the chapter as a whole. Also after being on PComm for a semester, I have seen how little pledges actually know about how involved they can be after they have crossed. When I have asked pledges what they see themselves doing after they have crossed a majority would answer that they want to big and I think this is the typical answer because most of the positions that they have been exposed to, like PComm and ExComm, are ones they cannot do during their probationary semester. I would want to expose them to the other chairing positions that would jumpstart them into making a difference in our chapter and just being more active in general.<br><br>

I know that the position of Pledgemaster comes with a lot of responsibility, but I believe that I am qualified for the job and that I would be able to use the influence as the Pledgemaster to turnout a great group of pledges. Thanks for reading!<br><br>

This is not a long, personal appeal like most people make. This is a platform, which means it is a list of proposed changes that will help you follow my speech, understand all the changes I'm proposing, and formulate any questions you may have about how I envision our pledging program for next semester.<br><br>

- family-based evaluation of pledges<br>
- shorter pledge test with interview afterwards<br>
- 1-page evaluation of each little from the bigs<br><br>

- ensured accountability of PComm<br>
- 2 co-trainers for every committee<br>
- bigs directly report to me about any problems between littles and PComm<br><br>

- more pledging checkpoints to keep pledges from falling behind<br><br>

This is by no means a complete list of all the changes I have in mind, and everything is subject to change depending on input from PComm and the rest of the chapter next semester. Feel free to ask for clarification on any of these points!<br><br>

Also, here's a copy of my APO resume for those of you who might be interested in seeing just how old I am:<br><br>

	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Hello, my brothers of Gamma Gamma chapter!!!<br><br>

Wait... before everything, I want to start out by saying that my experiences in Alpha Phi Omega, however short, as been nothing "short" of amazing. Alpha Phi Omega has allowed me to see things in bigger scope and relate to others more easily, and has aided me (and I am sure many others) in the transition to both the college experience and the Golden Bear experience.
<br><br>
Today, I am running to be the Admin VP for Fall 2011 semester.<br><br>

Although my experience within APO has been short, my experiences in newspaper and reserving rooms for large-scale events can really be an asset to Alpha Phi Omega.<br><br>

Although my experiences in maintaining a website are lacking, I believe that with the assistance of always-helpful Webmasters, I can definitely learn and help to keep a great website. As an Admin VP, I will hopefully make a much more simplified and clearer website, hopefully adding more information where it seems bare right now. In addition, I have maintained a blog with over 42,000 hits and although my program experiences were lacking, I was able to maintain a successful blog because of my articles and clear organization.<br><br>

I also hope to make the Gamma Gamma chapter Twitter a much more accessible and active account. Twitter can be a VERY useful tool and one of the most accessible forms of mass communication available today. I hope to utilize Gamma Gamma chapter's tweets more as an Admin VP. It is very user-friendly and hopefully will get our chapters words "out there".<br><br>

As for reserving rooms, I have reserved large amounts of rooms for the Cal Leadership Symposium 2011 as the logistics chair for its planning committee; although that was under special circumstances and unfortunately, the current system is the best available; thus I will try my best to get rooms that our members desire.<br><br>

The biggest part of my platform is the Stylus; the Stylus has been a huge part of me since my pledging semester and writing (and maintaining) a newsletter/newspaper/magazine has consistently been a huge part of my life. Outside of APO, I had been an Intern for both the Korea Daily Newspaper (the main newspaper located in LA) and the Korea Daily-affiliated San Diego Monthly magazine. I have been published frequently and was often called to translate and edit articles within the San Diego monthly magazine. Communication through written words has always been my forte and my passion and the Stylus is the main form of communication in APO. As the Admin VP, I will make sure there will be more submissions to Stylus by presenting an incentive; as of now, pledges and actives don't seem to send in any articles until the last moment. To avoid the last-minute rush to send the articles, I will make sure that the incentive (of a prize, that will be arranged as much as the budge allows) goes to the active/pledge with not only the most submissions but the steadiness of the submissions (so they're not rushed, but rather been in many Stylus issues with good quality articles/submissions).<br><br>

I know I am very young, in both APO-year-wise and my class-standing, but I know that being the Admin VP will not only be a lesson in growing personally in both sense of leadership and responsibility, but also working closer with the chapter as a whole. Thank you for reading this far and I hope that you will consider me for your vote.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Minkyung "MK" Kim<br><br>

	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dear Gamma Gamma,<br><br>

	I'm Tomomasa Terazaki and I pledged GL semester. When I chose to pledge APO, I thought that I was here just to do service. I did not imagine myself being on PComm or ExComm. However, I noticed that APO was the perfect place to strengthen my leadership skills. In APO, everyone has a chance to become a leader if they choose to. This semester, I had the chance to take on a big role by being the KS PComm Service Trainer. Being on PComm, I learned a lot about leadership. I had to stand in many situations I did not want to but I became a better leader and grew as an individual. After being on PComm, I feel comfortable taking on a bigger role in the chapter next semester, which is being on ExComm. After seriously considering about all the positions except Historian, I noticed that Admin VP is the perfect position for me.<br><br>

	 The three main jobs for Admin VP are to reserve rooms for chapter events, improve the chapter website, and print the Chapter's Stylus. I cannot really improve the first job, reserving rooms, but I will make sure to reserve the best room for each event.<br><br>

	The chapter website is one of the most important tools for us because without it, we cannot sign up for any service event or fellowship. This is why making sure the website is working correctly is very important. Also, as a Computer Science major, I will do my best to make some improvements on the website. I will learn whatever programming language the website is written in over the summer and try to make some changes so it can be even more useful.<br><br> 
	
	One of the biggest changes I can make as your Admin VP is the Chapter's Stylus. Honestly, not that many people read it but I will do my best to encourage other people to write interesting articles. I remember back when I was on Administrative Committee as a pledge, people told me that they would read my funny articles. For example, I wrote an article about how my life was when I had cornrows for a week. I know I will never get cornrows again but I will try to have an interesting life next semester so I can write articles about myself so you guys will be entertained reading my articles.<br><br>

	I owe APO so much and I want to give back by being the Admin VP next semester.  <br><br>

I am running to be your Fall 2011 Administrative VP. The ideal Admin VP needs to be responsible, creative, and tech-oriented and I believe I am that and much more. Not only do I have a strong passion for technology, I also have the passion to teach others how to use technology. I strive not to simply maintain the status quo, but to improve things we already have.<br><br>

 

As many of you already know, Admin VP is responsible for overseeing the writing of Stylus, the maintenance of the website, and reserving rooms for chapter events.<br><br>

 

In regards to Stylus, I was Stylus Chair during JLC semester and through this experience, I will be able to successfully lead the Stylus Chairs and committee next semester as well as bring in improvements for our newsletter. Some changes I would like to consider are (1) replacing the caption contest with a featured/best article contest. Individuals will therefore be encouraged to not only to submit to Stylus, but also to submit quality articles.  (2) Divide sections of the Stylus to different topics like a newspaper (main page, sports, business, personal, etc) so that potential contributors have ideas that they can build on rather than brainstorming for things to write.<br><br>

 

I also know the process of room reservations very well because it was an option I looked into when deciding on a location for Study Tables. Room reservation is really a combination of first-come-first-serve basis and luck of the draw. However, I would like to increase our chances of getting good rooms by taking the initiative to (1) meet with the administrators of room reservations in Sproul Hall and (2) speak with administrators of other organizations regarding their own reservations to see if they have any rooms they are not using but have reserved in the past.<br><br>

 

Furthermore, I am very familiar with the chapter website. I have some experience with it this semester as Academic Chair when I uploaded files for the testbank. I also know Java and HTML and am open to learning new languages (specifically, PHP). As Admin VP, I would like to work with other members of ExComm to complete parts of the website, such as "Fellowship", "History", etc. I will also work with the webmasters to improve or add on new features (such as having a specific section showing number of leadership credit under "requirements").<br><br>

 

I am running not only because I feel that I have the personality, experience, and skills to make a great Administrative VP, but also because I look forward to spreading these qualities on to others.<br><br>

</h2>
<div style="max-width: 50em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dearest Brothers,
For the past two years, Alpha Phi Omega has become quite an integral part of my life; having devoted countless hours to this organization, I can honestly say that it's been a worthwhile experience. In return, Alpha Phi Omega has given me much more than I had anticipated. I was blessed with inspiring trainers, a loving small fam, and numerous supporting pledge brothers. Having been so fortunate, I have strived to give back to the chapter to the best of my ability by taking on different leadership positions. I am now ready to further my contribution to our fraternity and work with the active brothers of our organization.<br><br>

Having had the opportunity to contribute to the pledge program by chairing rush and serving as leadership co-trainer has been rewarding, but I would like to focus on the actives of our chapter. After all, without actives, we wouldn't have any pledges!
The areas that I hope to maintain and improve as Membership Vice President are: RUSH, RETENTION, and COMMUNICATION.<br><br>

RUSH: Not only is this one of the biggest events of the semester, but also the first event we put on with our new actives! I would continue with the traditional 3-week rush program as I feel that is a sufficient amount of time. With previous experience in rush, I would serve as the overseer of Rush Chairs and guide them through the process every step of the way and ensure that we are all on the same page. I feel that teamwork and cohesiveness are essential to planning a successful rush. Ultimately, it's their show to put on! In addition to rush chairs, actives definitely play an important role with the process of flyering, tabling, and interacting with rushees. I will make certain that all brothers are informed; together, I believe that we can build a strong and united community to start off the semester with a BANG!<br><br>

RETENTION: As our chapter gets progressively larger and larger, it becomes more difficult to get to know everyone and some even lose incentive to attend events and end up falling into bad standing. I decided that seeing so many new faces is not an excuse to fall off the face of the APO planet. It so happens that in actuality, it BECOMES an incentive for actives to act as role models for new members and take on other roles in our fraternity-whether it is chairing a service project or being a big. I hope to motivate fellow brothers to attend events by providing more activities, such as active ONLY events and pledge class reunions. I will do my best to promote participation as well as encourage intermingling between pledge classes-old and new. ;) I'll break the ice first and talk to each and every one of you.<br><br>

Aside from the service aspect of our fraternity, I'm almost positive that most people stick around because of their small families. Having been a big in the past, I understand how stressful and frustrating it can escalate to at times, but I also know how wonderful and rewarding this task is. In order to help you all with the process, I want to communicate with every small family so that I know how you guys are doing. Communication is key, especially for the new bigs who may be unsure of certain responsibilities or traditions. I plan to provide both parents and bigs with fun and informative tips as a guide for the semester. They will know the minimal expectations and responsibilities as bigs or parents and for everything else, it's up to them!<br><br>

As you can see, there's a theme going on here-at the end of the day, it is what YOU are willing to contribute as an active and what YOU want to make of this experience. If elected as MVP, my personal objective is to be available and address any questions and concerns you may have as well as provide you with motivation and a worthwhile experience. In all honestly, I just want everyone to be happy and feel like they are a part of Alpha Phi Omega.
In Leadership, Friendship, and Service,

<div style="max-width: 50em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">Dear Gamma Gamma,<br><br>

Up until this past week, I was close to certain that I would be going associate next semester. But after spending a considerable amount of time with pledges and actives recently, I've been reminded of how much I love this chapter and that I want to stay active next semester as well as give back to a chapter that has changed my college career in indescribable ways. Having bigged and from serving on Pledge Committee in my past two active semesters, I feel that running for the position of Membership Vice President is the next step for me to take to make a difference in this chapter. <br><br>

Membership Vice President is a position that I feel not only suits me (and my background in and out of APO), but is also a position I've "eyed" since I crossed. RUSH, the family system, and active retention are the MVP's three principal priorities every semester, and I believe there is room for changes and improvements for the Fall 2011 semester.<br><br>

<b>RUSH</b><br>
Fall semesters are usually thought of as "the semester that's less intense" when it comes to rush because of the freshmen class that's harder to appeal to. Nonetheless, I think that really just means we should rush harder to try and appeal to more underclassmen. One of the things I've noticed is that a lot of pledges, particularly in my pledge class, GL's, pledged when they were upperclassmen or about to graduate. What that unfortunately means for the chapter is lower retention of actives because if you gotta graduate, you gotta graduate. As a chapter that invests heavily in the pledging process, I think it's really sad that it happens this way because there are a lot of great actives who never really have the opportunity to contribute to the chapter because they're graduating so soon. <br><br>

On that note, I want to propose initiating rush activities about a week earlier than it has been in recent past. At the start of the new school year, I believe we should be tabling at Calapalooza and out on Sproul starting at least by the second half of the first week of school. Additionally, I hope to move our all our rush traditions (flyering, tabling, info nights, etc.) up by at least half a week to increase our presence on campus early on. The first week is when most students are looking around to see what new clubs to join, and I feel as though an early start is crucial to a successful rush.<br><br>

<b>Family System</b><br>
I think I can speak for everyone in the chapter when I say that the family system is an integral part of everyone's experiences throughout pledging and active hood. First and foremost, we seek to develop as leaders, perform meaningful service, and make long-lasting friendships, every aspect of which is shaped by the people who surround us who feel like family. That said, it's the feeling of belonging of brotherhood, the feeling of family - whether that's among your bigs, your cosibs, your co-committee members, or anyone in the chapter.<br><br>

If elected MVP, I hope to have clear and comprehensive education for bigs, aunts and uncles, and parents to ensure that secrets and traditions are kept. I hope to implement more in the "bigging" workshop to clearly establish what actives are agreeing to by signing the bigging contract. I also plan to work more closely with the Pledgemaster and Pledge Committee in the process of sorting pledges into families. From personal experience, I think Pledge Committee has a lot of valuable feedback to offer for family sorting based on observations from ritual activities. Lastly, I hope to maintain communication with all of Pledge Committee throughout the semester to ensure things are running smoothly.<br><br>

<b>Active Retention</b><br>
Seeing as so many actives are graduating semester, it seems more important than ever to motivate and nurture active participation next semester. One way I see fit to approach this challenge is to have more opportunities for active retreat, and subsequently to have the attendance of at least one retreat fulfill a requirement. To accommodate more actives' schedules, I believe it would be appropriate to have more options (i.e. dates, activities) for retreat to ensure actives can bond again before the new pledge class arrives. I would work hard with active retreat chairs to plan early on to ensure the date(s) is not too far into the semester when stress loads pick up. Additionally, I plan to set up active-only events throughout the semester to encourage brothers to come out and reconnect with fellow actives in the chapter. From past experience, I feel as though GG Olympics was a valuable fellowship because those who attended had the opportunity to reconnect with their pledge brothers in a fun and competitive environment. I believe pledging semester tends to be many actives' favorite semester, and I think more active-only events similar to GG Olympics or Pledge Class Reunions would motivate brothers to stay active.<br><br>

All things considered, I hope you will carefully consider my candidacy for the position of Membership Vice President. I would be honored to have this opportunity to serve this chapter and I intend to do my best.<br><br>

<div style="max-width: 50em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">I want to be Fellowship VP so that I can set an example for the chapter and exemplify the three cardinal principals of APO, specifically friendship. One reason why I love APO so much is the fellowship that is created within the chapter. After two years of absence from APO, I was still willing to come back, despite the fact that most of my pledge brothers and previous friends were gone or graduated. I knew that the people in APO are very willing to meet new people. I maintained that mentality as I came back and tried my very best to meet everybody I could. I have to admit that it was hard, and some people were reluctant to reach out to a new face like me, but I still kept and keep a positive attitude in meeting new brothers.<br><br>

This is the vision I want for each and every fellowship we have on the calendar. I realize that lots of fellowships are linked closely with certain groups of people in APO, but I want to encourage fellowships to have diversity. On the contrary, I am one to join a fellowship without regards to who or what family is there. If I see an activity I like, I will join in and meet people there. I want to make this clear to everybody that these fellowships are here to build bonds between each other, whether it be new bonds or old, so please don't exclude or ostracize any brother at fellowships.<br><br>

A way to encourage more fellowshipping at events is to have the chairs of each fellowship be in charge of having the attendees mingle with each other, especially brothers who don't know each other. I know I can't check every single fellowship to ensure that it happens, but I will do my best to follow up on how the chairs did by giving random Fellowship Chair Evaluations. But I hope this can be a group effort, and not just something I have to enforce. I want everybody to understand that it should be everybody's obligation as an active and soon-to-be brother to make it an effort to fellowship every brother in the chapter. It should be something that you enjoy doing because doing so definitely shows LFS.<br><br>

Lastly, I have some really great fellowship ideas. One of the big ones I hope to start is a chapter-wide (possibly interchapter-wide) scavenger hunt in SF. Kind of like amazing race. I also think we should go rock climbing, hiking, camping or any other outdoorsy type activities.<br><br>

<i>Life is a waste of time, and time is a waste of life; So waste your time, and <b>have the time of your life.</b></i><br><br>

I pledged GL semester, and studied abroad Fall 2010. During GL semester as a FunComm trainee, I came to respect and value the brotherhood and friendship aspect of APO, a strong stake in our organization that distinguishes us from other service organizations on campus. As a pledge on FunComm, we were required to make "creative" fellowships, which I had so much fun planning as I was able to do these fun crazy things. Because of the amazingly diverse group of people at GG, no matter how eccentric and out-there some fellowships may be, there is always someone down to try something new and creative. During pledging semester, I have created new creative fellowships such as going the Milpitas Shooting Range and windsurfing at the Berkeley Marina (though weather did not permit us to do so).<br><br>

After going abroad in the summer and fall of 2010, I realized that there are so many things to try in the world, but so little time. As Thoreau said, "We should come home from adventures, and perils, and discoveries every day with new experience and character". So why not try as many new things as possible with our lovely APO brothers? Though we have many great fellowships on the calendar today, my election platform is to promote the organization and division of different arenas of fellowship to encourage a greater diversity of fun things for us to do as brothers.<br><br>

If elected, I propose to create the positions of these Fellowship VP Chairs to oversee the respective divisions of fellowship, which will foster the creation of a more diversified, new and exhilarating events.<br><br>

<b>Food & Leisure</b><br>
So everyone eats, and APO is no exception. This division will ensure that there are fair amount of food fellowships per week, so if you have a break at a certain time or knows that you have a long day on Thursday, you can look forward to getting CREAM or Indian food while bonding with others. In addition, many "chill" fellowships will most definitely ensue during great weather times. During the sunny days of early fall, weekly leisure events can be created such as "Tanning Thursdays" if anyone has a break in between classes, you can join your fellow brothers to get some Vitamin D on Memorial Glade.<br><br>

<b>Special Events & Entertainment</b><br>
So many events on Campus, in Berkeley, in Bay Area!! One thing I have always loved about APO is that if there is an awesome event going on, it's 99% guaranteed that it is on the calendar, and if I just sign up for it I'll have great company to go with. Events on campus such as Movement showcases, Superb movie showings, concerts in Oakland and San Francisco, perhaps some monthly shopping trips, and Avenue Q musical in SF, Dave & Buster Wednesdays, etc, will be regularly put on the calendar to see if there are any people interested in going. I feel like there are events that people want to go, but it's only fun going in a group of people. This division of the fellowship will ensures that there will be an entertainment section to brotherhood even in a week when everyone keeps putting up CREAM fellowships. (unless it's midterm season and everyone doesn't want to be entertained and just needs sugar)<br><br>

<b>Sporting Events</b><br>
Need I say more? APO IM basketball!! And also what we love about fall, FOOTBALL GAMES! And in addition, the sporting events will encompass weekly workouts, to ensure that at least one RSF event (RSF Group X classes, or workout hour) is on the calendar per week to get our adrenaline going. We all have excuses to not workout, but if it's already on the calendar and you know people are there with you, it's that much more encouraging to get yourself to the gym. :] Exercise Endorphins Happiness.<br><br>

<b>Travels & Adventures</b><br>
This is a new division that I want to introduce to the fellowship aspect of APO. St. Augustine said, "The World is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page." During breaks or long weekends, or even normal weekends after midterm seasons, some of us might want to get out of town and enjoy the immense greatness of life elsewhere. In the fall, California will be beautiful, and weekend travels to Big Sur or Lake Tahoe will be lovely and it will be a great bonding experience. And if the snow gods hit the Sierra Mountains before the semester ends, snowboarding trips will definitely be planned for all the adrenaline junkies. During Thanksgiving or Christmas breaks if you're not visiting family or home, why not join fellow brothers in exploring new places? I know for spring break in the past I have been trying to organize a Cancun trip, but since no one really knew what's going on or trusted in the travel planning of APO, we haven't gone. But with this new division, there will be a highly organized planning of any big travel plans, and it will make the friendship and fun aspect of APO that much more amazing.<br><br>

I believe my creativity, love for friendship, and passion for adventures will bring out the highest potential of fellowship in APO. Life is an uncharted territory, and settling is for dust particles. So let's make some history, and have the times of our lives!<br><br>

Cheers!<br><brz

I'm running for Historian VP because I want to contribute to the chapter at a larger level and record all the wonderful
memories for the chapter. When I first pledged last semester, I honestly did not think I would take on any
executive leadership roles in Alpha Phi Omega. However, while being on H-comm and Scrapbook Committee
last semester, I realized I wanted to contribute more to the arts and crafts aspects for the chapter. So I decided to
chair for Scrapbook Committee and join FunPack this semester. I believe one of the most important task as HVP
is to delegate tasks to the chairs and make sure they are on top of their responsibilities. By being on both Scrapbook
and FunPack, I believe I have or will have a good idea of what the two big HVP committees do and what
needs to be done. Also, I really enjoy making crafty things and I'm very meticulous about it so I will ensure the
good quality of Scrapbook and FunPack for the semester.<br><br>
One of the problems for the HVP is that actives tend to not upload a lot of pictures onto SmugMug. I will improve
this by rewarding the person whom uploads the most pictures and thus creating more incentive. I will also
constantly post ads on stylus to remind actives and pledges about uploading pictures and other historian meetings
and events.<br><br>
As for alumni events, so far we've done bonfire (JM), bowling (GL), poker (JLC), eating (KS), and alumni
panel. I would probably like to plan one small scale event such as eating with alumni and one big scale event
such as a day trip to a theme park, Santa Cruz, or snowboarding, etc., to really encourage bringing more alumni
back. By keeping strong alumni relations, pledges and actives can get a sense of life in the working world and
get an idea what they want to do after they graduate and perhaps alumni also could contribute to the chapter by
recommending more service and job opportunities to the fraternity, actives, and pledges. So it is quite important
to tie them back to the system and let them know that LFS of this fraternity do not just end when they graduate.
The fraternity always welcomes them home.<br><br>
Next semester is going to be my last semester at Cal so I definitely want to make the best out of it! Thank you
for reading and hope I'm worthy of your vote!<br><br>
